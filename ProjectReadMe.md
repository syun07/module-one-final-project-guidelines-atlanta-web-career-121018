Welcome to our pet finding app, Adopt-Don’t-Shop! We are so excited to assist in making all your fuzzy dreams come true!

Background:
Sarah and I share a love of animals- especially cats. We both have three each, which we discovered on the first day of class. This commonality led us to this amazing creation. We hope to spread the joy pets can bring.

Use:
Let the prompts guide you! There will always be a list of options to choose from. We designed the app to enable an effortless beginning to pet care-taking.

More to Come:
We envision a dynamic app that will eventually expand into a pet adoption delivery service. Think of how UberEats has revolutionized food delivery. We’re looking to do the same with pet adoptions! Whether you’re not able to visit the shelter during business hours or if you’re homebound, etc… Our app will empower you to adopt!
